## StrSymmetryPoint

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(String S); }

that, given a string S, returns the index (counting from 0) of a character such that the part of the string to the left of that character is a reversal of the part of the string to its right. The function should return −1 if no such index exists.

Note: reversing an empty string (i.e. a string whose length is zero) gives an empty string.

For example, given a string:

"racecar"

the function should return 3, because the substring to the left of the character "e" at index 3 is "rac", and the one to the right is "car".

Given a string:

"x"

the function should return 0, because both substrings are empty.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

the length of S is within the range [0..2,000,000].

## OddOccurrencesInArray

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.

For example, in array A such that:

  A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
  A[6] = 9
the elements at indexes 0 and 2 have value 9,
the elements at indexes 1 and 3 have value 3,
the elements at indexes 4 and 6 have value 9,
the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.
Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
  A[6] = 9
the function should return 7, as explained in the example above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an odd integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.

## MinAbsSumOfTwo

Let A be a non-empty array consisting of N integers.

The abs sum of two for a pair of indices (P, Q) is the absolute value |A[P] + A[Q]|, for 0 ≤ P ≤ Q < N.

For example, the following array A:

  A[0] =  1
  A[1] =  4
  A[2] = -3
has pairs of indices (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2). 
The abs sum of two for the pair (0, 0) is A[0] + A[0] = |1 + 1| = 2. 
The abs sum of two for the pair (0, 1) is A[0] + A[1] = |1 + 4| = 5. 
The abs sum of two for the pair (0, 2) is A[0] + A[2] = |1 + (−3)| = 2. 
The abs sum of two for the pair (1, 1) is A[1] + A[1] = |4 + 4| = 8. 
The abs sum of two for the pair (1, 2) is A[1] + A[2] = |4 + (−3)| = 1. 
The abs sum of two for the pair (2, 2) is A[2] + A[2] = |(−3) + (−3)| = 6. 
Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimal abs sum of two for any pair of indices in this array.

For example, given the following array A:

  A[0] =  1
  A[1] =  4
  A[2] = -3
the function should return 1, as explained above.

Given array A:

  A[0] = -8
  A[1] =  4
  A[2] =  5
  A[3] =-10
  A[4] =  3
the function should return |(−8) + 5| = 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].
